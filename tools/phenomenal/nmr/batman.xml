     **BATMAN**     
     
     BATMAN (Bayesian AuTomated Metabolite Analyzer for NMR) deconvolves resonance peaks from NMR spectra of complex mixtures and obtains relative concentration estimates for the corresponding metabolites. This is achieved through a database of spectral profiles for known metabolites and a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm.
     For each metabolite in the database, users have the option to specify the multiplet position, range of allowed positional shifts, peak width range and so on. This is a PhenoMeNal implementation of the standalone BATMAN package. Parallel processing is available if processing several spectra. Documentation including installation and testing instructions for the **standalone** version can be found at:
     http://batman.r-forge.r-project.org/

     **Input Files**
          
     *Four mandatory files*
     
     NMRdata.txt, batmanOptions.txt, multi_data_user.csv, metabolitesList.csv
     
     - *NMRdata.txt* is the NMR spectra data for BATMAN to process peak fitting. The *NMRdata.txt* is a tabulated file with the first column of data as ppm and subsequent columns the NMR intensity for each spectrum.
     
     - *batmanOptions.txt* is used for controlling BATMAN performance including the number range of spectra to be processed (the max number must NOT be greater than the number of spectra provided in the NMRdata.txt), the number of parallel processes, the number of prior iterations and posterior ones, the global peak width and variation (in log10) etc. The detail can be found in the BATMAN document for the standalone version above. Please modify the file accordingly on your local computer before uploading to Galaxy.
     
     - *multi_data_user.csv* provides the characteristics of targeted metabolites NMR resonances. Please modify the file accordingly on your local computer before uploading to Galaxy.
     
     - *metabolitesList.csv* includes the list of targeted metabolites. Please modify the file accordingly on your local computer before uploading to Galaxy.
